# EGEN310
Due to the circumstances of this semester and COVID-19 the code for the car can not be completed or tested with our personal components.
What will be included is basic boiler plate/skeleton code. Which in no means will be as exhasutive as it should be as we would have to physically integrate our components and i do not own any of the hardware so i can only make guesses with my code.
